czarnoff-dotfiles
=================

All the dotfiles worth keeping.


This repository stores my favorite scripts and program configuration as stored in rc files.

This repository may also include submodules.  They will be cloned by the install.sh script.

Once the files have been checked out of Github, one can run the install.sh script.  It will remove the original files and make links to the cloned location.  This way any future changes can be easily added to the repository.
